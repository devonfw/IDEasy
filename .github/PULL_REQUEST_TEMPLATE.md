| Milestones are typically assigned by PO (Jörg) but have to be set before issues and PRs get closed. In case your issue is only addressed by a change in 'ide-mirrors/ide-urls or in ide-settings` repository, please already assign the according milestone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | &#9744; | &#9744; |

| The feature branch of the PR is up-to-date with the `main` branch.<br/><br/>If you see `This branch is out-of-date with the base branch` in the PR click the `Update branch` button to fix (or manually merge with the main from upstream locally and push your changes). In case you see `This branch has conflicts that must be resolved` instead, you need to resolve conflicts. Very simple conflicts may be resolved in the browser on GitHub. But as a general recommendation you should resolve the conflicts locally with proper merge tool support and rerun tests before you push the merged changes.                                                                                                             | &#9744; | &#9744; |

| In case your PR adds a new tool `«tool»` as commandlet there are the following additional checks:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | &#9744; | &#9744; |
