== Pitch

With IDEasy you can create a very small git repo with the configuration of the dev environment of your software project.
Developers can then setup your project using IDEasy with a single CLI command on Windows, Mac, or Linux and get all the tools needed for your project in the configured version and tailored to the projects demands.

No more manual steps to install and configure, no diff-wars, no more dev setup manuals, no more "its not working on my machine"!

Among many link:documentation/alternatives.adoc[alternatives] we believe IDEasy is the best solution for project centric software development needs esp. with its link:documentation/sandbox.adoc[sandbox concept].

Not yet convinced?
See link:documentation/features.adoc[features].

== Status

Currently we focused on support for Windows while official Linux and Mac support are still a little bit work in progress (see e.g. bug https://github.com/devonfw/IDEasy/issues/451[#451]).
Further, we still recommend that you should contact us if you plan to use IDEasy in your project with a larger developer team.
We surely try to fix bugs as soon as possible but we do not work extra shifts or prioritize your issues if you are blocked and we never promised any help before.

== Setup

=== Prerequisites

All you need before installing IDEasy is https://git-scm.com/download/[git].

=== Install

Download the latest version of `IDEasy` from https://github.com/devonfw/IDEasy/releases[here] and install it.

=== Create projects

Once installed, you can setup a new project with the following command:

```
ide create «project-name» [«settings-git-url»]
```

If you do not have a `«settings-git-url»`, you can omit it to setup a standard Java project as demo.
