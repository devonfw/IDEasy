== Pitch

With IDEasy you can create a very small git repo with the configuration of the dev environment of your software project.
Developers can then setup your project using IDEasy with a single CLI command on Windows, Mac, or Linux and get all the tools needed for your project in the configured version and tailored to the projects demands.

No more manual steps to install and configure, no diff-wars, no more dev setup manuals, no more "its not working on my machine"!

Among many link:documentation/alternatives.adoc[alternatives] we believe IDEasy is the best solution for project centric software development needs esp. with its link:documentation/sandbox.adoc[sandbox concept].

Not yet convinced?
See link:documentation/features.adoc[features].

== Setup

=== Prerequisites

All you need before installing IDEasy is https://git-scm.com/download/[git].

=== Install

Download the latest version of `IDEasy` from https://github.com/devonfw/IDEasy/releases[here] and install it.
(You can find all Releases in https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/devonfw/tools/IDEasy/ide-cli/[Maven Central])

=== Create projects

Once installed, you can setup a new project with the following command:

```
ide create «project-name» [«settings-git-url»]
```

If you do not have a `«settings-git-url»`, you can omit it to setup a standard Java project as demo.
