== Pitch

With IDEasy you can create a very small git repo with the configuration of the dev environment of your software project.
Developers can then setup your project using IDEasy with a single CLI command on Windows, Mac, or Linux and get all the tools needed for your project in the configured version and tailored to the projects demands.

No more manual steps to install and configure, no diff-wars, no more dev setup manuals, no more "its not working on my machine"!

Among many link:documentation/alternatives.adoc[alternatives] we believe IDEasy is the best solution for project centric software development needs esp. with its link:documentation/sandbox.adoc[sandbox concept].

Not yet convinced?
See link:documentation/features.adoc[features].

== Status

NOTE: Currently IDEasy is in beta state so it is not yet considered to be production ready. Do not use it with large teams or otherwise do not blame us if your team gets blocked by a bug.

We are planning to go out of beta beginning of 2025.
However, this will only include support for Windows while official Linux and Mac support will come later in 2025.
Further, you should contact us if you plan to use IDEasy in your project with a real developer team.
We will have a look and can give you the latest insights about features working stable and edge-cases that might still cause problems.
Do not expect reasoable support if you started with IDEasy in 2024 with a large team but without getting in touch.
We surely try to fix bugs as soon as possible but we do not work extra shifts if you are blocked and we never promised any help before.
Also, if you are currently working with devonfw-ide, please stay patient.
You can surely do a pilot where one developer tries to work with IDEasy in your devonfw-ide project and see if all works fine or better.
But unless we update this status and officially annouce that devonfw-ide shall be replaced with IDEasy you should not push this ahead with your developer teams.

== Setup

=== Prerequisites

All you need before installing IDEasy is https://git-scm.com/download/[git].

=== Install

Download the latest version of `IDEasy` from https://github.com/devonfw/IDEasy/releases[here] and install it.
(You can find all Releases in https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/devonfw/tools/IDEasy/ide-cli/[Maven Central])

=== Create projects

Once installed, you can setup a new project with the following command:

```
ide create «project-name» [«settings-git-url»]
```

If you do not have a `«settings-git-url»`, you can omit it to setup a standard Java project as demo.
