= Migration to IDEasy

If you used devonfw-ide for your projects so far, and you want to switch to IDEasy, you should follow these steps in order to do it properly:

Step 1: Follow the https://github.com/devonfw/IDEasy/blob/main/documentation/setup.adoc[setup] guide to properly install IDEasy

Step 2: Get rid of all legacy by calling the following command:

[source]
----
upgrade-settings
----

Step 3: After running the command, you might need to update your xml files for our merger.
Please consider reading our documentation for that topic:
https://github.com/devonfw/IDEasy/blob/main/documentation/configurator.adoc
