= Variables

`IDEasy` defines a set of standard variables to your environment for link:configuration.adoc[configuration].
These environment variables are described by the following table.
Those variables printed *bold* are also exported in your shell (except for windows CMD that does not have such concept).
Variables with the value `-` are not set by default but may be set via link:configuration.adoc[configuration] to override defaults.
Please note that we are trying to minimize any potential side-effect from `IDEasy` to the outside world by reducing the number of variables and only exporting those that are required.
