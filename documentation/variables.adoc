= Variables

`IDEasy` defines a set of standard variables to your environment for link:configuration.adoc[configuration].
These environment variables are described by the following table.
Those variables printed *bold* are also exported in your shell (except for windows CMD that does not have such concept).
Variables with the value `-` are not set by default but may be set via link:configuration.adoc[configuration] to override defaults.
Please note that we are trying to minimize any potential side-effect from `IDEasy` to the outside world by reducing the number of variables and only exporting those that are required.

.Variables of IDEasy

|=======================
|*Variable*|*Value*|*Meaning*
|`IDE_ROOT`|e.g. `~/projects/` or `C:\projects`|The installation root directory of `IDEasy` - see link:structure.adoc[structure] for details.
|`IDE_HOME`|e.g. `/projects/my-project`|The top level directory of your `IDEasy` project.
|`IDE_OPTIONS`| |General options that will be applied to each call of `IDEasy`. Should typically be used for JVM options like link:proxy-support.adoc[proxy-support].

|*`M2_REPO`*|`$IDE_HOME/conf/mvn/repository`|Path to your local maven repository. For projects without high security demands, you may change this to the maven default `~/.m2/repository` and share your repository among multiple projects.
|*`MVN_HOME`*|`$IDE_HOME/software/mvn`|Path to Maven
|*`MAVEN_ARGS`*|`-s $IDE_HOME/conf/mvn/settings.xml`|Maven arguments. This variable is set just if the `settings.xml` file in link:conf.adoc[conf] is found.

|`PREFERRED_GIT_PROTOCOL`| |Allows to enforce a specific protocol for git. Options are `git` (for SSH) and `https`. If set any git URL will automatically be converted to the preferred protocol before IDEasy clones it.
