= Variables

`IDEasy` defines a set of standard variables to your environment for link:configuration.adoc[configuration].
These environment variables are described by the following table.
Those variables printed *bold* are also exported in your shell (except for windows CMD that does not have such concept).
Variables with the value `-` are not set by default but may be set via link:configuration.adoc[configuration] to override defaults.
Please note that we are trying to minimize any potential side-effect from `IDEasy` to the outside world by reducing the number of variables and only exporting those that are required.

.Variables of IDEasy
[options="header"]
|=======================
|*Variable*|*Value*|*Meaning*
|`IDE_ROOT`|e.g. `~/projects/` or `C:\projects`|The installation root directory of `IDEasy` - see link:structure.adoc[structure] for details.
|`IDE_HOME`|e.g. `/projects/my-project`|The top level directory of your `IDEasy` project.
|`IDE_OPTIONS`| |General options that will be applied to each call of `IDEasy`. Should typically be used for JVM options like link:proxy-support.adoc[proxy-support].
|`PATH`|`$IDE_HOME/software/«tool»:...:$PATH`|You system path is adjusted by `ide` link:cli.adoc[command].
|`IDE_TOOLS`|`(java mvn node npm)`|List of tools that should be installed by default on project creation.
|`CREATE_START_SCRIPTS`| |List of IDEs that shall be used by developers in the project and therefore start-scripts are created on setup. E.g. `(eclipse intellij vscode)`
|*`WORKSPACE`*|`main`|The link:workspaces.adoc[workspace] you are currently in. Defaults to `main` if you are not inside a link:workspaces.adoc[workspace]. Never set this variable in any `ide.properties` file.
|`WORKSPACE_PATH`|`$IDE_HOME/workspaces/$WORKSPACE`|Absolute path to current link:workspaces.adoc[workspace]. Never set this variable in any `ide.properties` file.
|*`«TOOL»_HOME`*|`$IDE_HOME/software/«tool»`|Path to «tool»
|*`M2_REPO`*|`$IDE_HOME/conf/mvn/repository`|Path to your local maven repository. For projects without high security demands, you may change this to the maven default `~/.m2/repository` and share your repository among multiple projects.
|*`MVN_HOME`*|`$IDE_HOME/software/mvn`|Path to Maven
|*`MAVEN_ARGS`*|`-s $IDE_HOME/conf/mvn/settings.xml`|Maven arguments. This variable is set just if the `settings.xml` file in link:conf.adoc[conf] is found.
|*`DOCKER_EDITION`*|`rancher`| If set as `docker` the command `ide install docker` will setup Docker Desktop globally at the users computer what requires a subscription/license for professional usage. If set to `rancher` or undefined it will install Rancher Desktop instead.
|*`GRAALVM_HOME`*|`$IDE_HOME/software/extra/graalvm`|Path to GraalVM
|*`IDE_VARIABLE_SYNTAX_LEGACY_SUPPORT_ENABLED`*|`true`|Enable/disable legacy support for devonfw-ide link:configurator.adoc[configuration templates] in IDE workspace folders.
|`ECLIPSE_VMARGS`|`-Xms128M -Xmx768M -XX:MaxPermSize=256M`|JVM options for Eclipse
|`PREFERRED_GIT_PROTOCOL`| |Allows to enforce a specific protocol for git. Options are `ssh` (for SSH) and `https`. If set any git URL will automatically be converted to the preferred protocol before IDEasy clones it. This option should only be set for individual users in `$IDE_HOME/conf/ide.properties` or `~/.ide/ide.properties` (and not in shared `settings`).
|`FAIL_ON_AMBIGOUS_MERGE`| |If set to `true` the link:configurator.adoc#element-identification[merge:id] is ambiguous and the resulting XPath expression matches multiple elements. Typically the link:usage.adoc#admin[IDE admin] did something wrong in the workspace template configuration. However, we decided to log a warning if that happens and use the first match by default to prevent our users from being blocked or annoyed in case of such configuration error. With this property you can enforce that this is handled as error aborting the merge. If that happens the user sees the stacktrace of the error and gets asked if he want to continue in order to launch his IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode, etc.).
|`«TOOL»_EDITION`|`«tool»`|The edition of the tool `«TOOL»` to install and use (e.g. `ECLIPSE_EDITION`, `INTELLIJ_EDITION` or `DOCKER_EDITION`). Default of `DOCKER_EDITION` is `rancher`.
|`«TOOL»_VERSION`|`*`|The version of the tool `«TOOL»` to install and use (e.g. `ECLIPSE_VERSION` or `MVN_VERSION`).
|`«TOOL»_BUILD_OPTS`| |The arguments provided to the build-tool `«TOOL»` in order to run a build. E.g.`clean install`
|`«TOOL»_RELEASE_OPTS`| |The arguments provided to the build-tool `«TOOL»` in order to perform a release build. E.g.`clean deploy -Dchangelist= -Pdeploy`
