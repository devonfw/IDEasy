= Variables

`IDEasy` defines a set of standard variables to your environment for link:configuration.adoc[configuration].
These environment variables are described by the following table.
Those variables printed *bold* are also exported in your shell (except for windows CMD that does not have such concept).
Variables with the value `-` are not set by default but may be set via link:configuration.adoc[configuration] to override defaults.
Please note that we are trying to minimize any potential side-effect from `IDEasy` to the outside world by reducing the number of variables and only exporting those that are required.

.Variables of IDEasy
[options="header"]
|=======================
|*Variable*|*Value*|*Meaning*
|`IDE_ROOT`|e.g. `/projects/` or `C:\projects`|The installation root directory of `IDEasy` - see link:structure.adoc[structure] for details.
|`IDE_HOME`|e.g. `/projects/my-project`|The top level directory of your `IDEasy` project.
|`IDE_OPTIONS`|`-`|General options that will be applied to each call of `IDEasy`. Should typically be used for JVM options like link:proxy-support.adoc[proxy-support].
|`PATH`|`$IDE_HOME/software/java:...:$PATH`|You system path is adjusted by `ide` link:cli.adoc[command].
|`HOME_DIR`|`~`|The platform independent home directory of the current user. In some edge-cases (e.g. in cygwin) this differs from `~` to ensure a central home directory for the user on a single machine in any context or environment.
|`IDE_TOOLS`|`(java mvn node npm)`|List of tools that should be installed by default on project creation.
|`CREATE_START_SCRIPTS`|``|List of IDEs that shall be used by developers in the project and therefore start-scripts are created on setup. E.g. `(eclipse intellij vscode)`
|*`WORKSPACE`*|`main`|The link:workspaces.adoc[workspace] you are currently in. Defaults to `main` if you are not inside a link:workspaces.adoc[workspace]. Never set this variable in any `ide.properties` file.
|`WORKSPACE_PATH`|`$IDE_HOME/workspaces/$WORKSPACE`|Absolute path to current link:workspaces.adoc[workspace]. Never set this variable in any `ide.properties` file.
|*`JAVA_HOME`*|`$IDE_HOME/software/java`|Path to JDK
|*`M2_REPO`*|`$IDE_HOME/conf/mvn/repository`|Path to your local maven repository. For projects without high security demands, you may change this to the maven default `~/.m2/repository` and share your repository among multiple projects.
|*`MVN_HOME`*|`$IDE_HOME/software/mvn`|Path to Maven
|*`MAVEN_ARGS`*|`-s $IDE_HOME/conf/mvn/settings.xml`|Maven arguments. This variable is set just if the `settings.xml` file in link:conf.adoc[conf] is found.
|*`DOCKER_EDITION`*|`rancher`| If set as `docker` the command `ide install docker` will setup Docker Desktop globally at the users computer what requires a subscription/license for professional usage. If set to `rancher` or undefined it will install Rancher Desktop instead.
|*`GRAALVM_HOME`*|`$IDE_HOME/software/extra/graalvm`|Path to GraalVM
|*`IDE_VARIABLE_SYNTAX_LEGACY_SUPPORT_ENABLED`*|`true`|Enable/disable legacy support for devonfw-ide link:configurator.adoc[configuration templates] in IDE workspace folders.
|`ECLIPSE_VMARGS`|`-Xms128M -Xmx768M -XX:MaxPermSize=256M`|JVM options for Eclipse
|`PREFERRED_GIT_PROTOCOL`|``|Allows to enforce a specific protocol for git. Options are `git` (for SSH) and `https`. If set any git URL will automatically be converted to the preferred protocol before IDEasy clones it. This option should only be set for individual users in `$IDE_HOME/conf/ide.properties` or `~/.ide/ide.properties` (and not in shared `settings`).
|`«TOOL»_EDITION`|`«tool»`|The edition of the tool `«TOOL»` to install and use (e.g. `ECLIPSE_EDITION`, `INTELLIJ_EDITION` or `DOCKER_EDITION`). Default of `DOCKER_EDITION` is `rancher`.
|`«TOOL»_VERSION`|`*`|The version of the tool `«TOOL»` to install and use (e.g. `ECLIPSE_VERSION` or `MVN_VERSION`).
|`«TOOL»_BUILD_OPTS`|e.g.`clean install`|The arguments provided to the build-tool `«TOOL»` in order to run a build.
|`«TOOL»_RELEASE_OPTS`|e.g.`clean deploy -Dchangelist= -Pdeploy`|The arguments provided to the build-tool `«TOOL»` in order to perform a release build.
