= IDEasy Installation on Ubuntu in WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

== Preparation

=== Install WSL

WSL for Windows can be installed through the Windows terminal (PowerShell, Git Bash, or CMD) using the following command:

----
wsl --install
----

For more details, refer to: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install[WSL Installation (Microsoft Documentation)]

=== Install Ubuntu from Microsoft Store

Download Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store:
https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PDXGNCFSCZV?hl=en-us&gl=DE&ocid=pdpshare[Microsoft Store]

== IDEasy Setup via Ubuntu Terminal

=== Prerequisite

Ensure Git is installed on your system.
Check by running:

```

git --version

```

If Git is not installed, use the following command:

```

sudo apt install git

```

=== Download and Setup IDEasy

Refer to the detailed setup guide: link:setup.adoc[Setup Instructions].

To install IDEasy for Linux via the terminal:

1. Copy the Maven link for the latest release.
2. Download the file using `wget`:

```

wget «link-to-repo»

```

Verify the downloaded file using:

```

ls

```

Create a new directory and extract the downloaded file:

```

mkdir «destination-folder-name»
tar xzf «file-name» -C «destination-folder-name»

```

This extracts the contents into the specified folder.
Run the setup script inside the extracted folder:

```

./«destination-folder-name»/setup

```

For example, if the folder name is `IDEasy`:

```

./IDEasy/setup

```

Follow the instructions in the terminal.
After installation, reboot the system:

```

sudo reboot

```

IDEasy is now installed on your Ubuntu system.
A new directory called `projects` will be created.

=== Prerequisites: Guidelines and Getting Started

Please review these documents before proceeding:

* link:IDEasy-contribution-rules-and-guidelines.adoc[Rules and Guidelines]
* link:IDEasy-contribution-getting-started.adoc[Getting Started]

=== Create an IDEasy Project

Run the following command to create an IDEasy project:

```

ide create IDEasy -

```

Navigate to the workspace directory:

```

cd projects/IDEasy/workspaces/main

```

Clone your forked project into this directory:

```

git clone «forked-project-url»

```

Now you can open the project in your preferred IDE using the `ide` command.
For IntelliJ:

```

ide intellij

```

In IntelliJ, select the `pom.xml` file and right-click → **Add as Maven Project**.

*Tip:* If the Maven button is hidden or not visible, press `Alt + 7` to open the **Structure** window below the project explorer.
Scroll down in the explorer to make the `pom.xml` file appear higher, enabling the option to be clicked.
Alternatively, use the keyboard arrows to navigate to the bottom of the right-click menu.
