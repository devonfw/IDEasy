= Setup

== Prerequisites
We try to make it as simple as possible for you.
However, there are some minimal prerequisites:

* You need to have a tool to extract `*.tar.gz` files (`tar` and `gzip`). On Windows before Version 10 (1803) use https://www.7-zip.org/[7-zip]. On all other platforms this comes out of the box.
* You need to have https://git-scm.com[git].
** On Windows you only need to download and install https://git-scm.com/download/win[git for windows].
** On Linux you might need to install the git in case it is not present (e.g. `sudo apt-get install git` or `sudo yum install git-core`)
** On MacOS you only need to download and install https://git-scm.com/download/mac[git for mac].

== Download
The latest release of `IDEasy` can be downloaded from https://github.com/devonfw/IDEasy/releases[here].

== Install
Create a central folder `projects` folder (on Windows use `C:\projects` or `D:\projects`, on Linux or Mac use `/projects` or if you do not have such permissions you create it in your home directory as `~/projects`). Inside this folder, create a sub-folder for your new project such as `my-project` and extract the contents of the downloaded archive (`ide-cli-*.tar.gz`) to this new folder. Run the command `setup` in this folder (on windows double clicking on `setup.bat`).
That's all. To get started read the link:usage.adoc[usage].

== Uninstall
To "uninstall" your `IDEasy` you only need to call the following command:
```
ide uninstall
```
Then you can delete the `projects` folder if there is no project data left that you need.

`IDEasy` is designed to be *non-invasive* to your operating system and computer. Therefore it is not "installed" on your system in a classical way. Instead you just create a folder and extract the xref:download[downloaded] archive to it. All the other softwares remain locally in your IDEasy folder. However, there are the following excuses (what is reverted by `ide uninstall`):

* The `ide` command is copied to your home directory (`~/.ide/scripts/ide`)
* The `ide` alias is added to your shell config (`~/.bashrc` and `~/.zshrc`, search for `alias ide="source ~/.ide/scripts/ide"`).
* On Windows the `ide.bat` command is copied to your home directory (`%USERPROFILE%\.ide\scripts\ide.bat`)
* On Windows this `%USERPROFILE%\.ide\scripts` directory is added to the `PATH` of your user.
* `IDEasy` will download all third party software to your `~/Downloads/ide` folder to reduce redundant storage. You have to delete this folder manually as we do not want to be responsible for data-loss in case users manually put files here.

== Testing SNAPSHOT releases

Whenever a story in `IDEasy` is completed by merging a https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests[PR],
our https://github.com/features/actions[github actions] will build a new SNAPSHOT release and on success deploy it to nexus on OSSRH.
You can therefore find the latest IDEasy SNAPSHOT releases https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/devonfw/tools/IDEasy/ide-cli/[here].
Simply choose the latest SNAPSHOT version folder and then inside the `*.tar.gz` file for the latest version.
Once downloaded, you can proceed as with official releases (see xref:install[install]).

If you test the latest SNAPSHOT please also give feedback to bug or feature tickets to let us know if things are working or not.
Thanks for your testing, support and help to make IDEasy better!
