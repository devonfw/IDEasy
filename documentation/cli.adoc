= Ide CLI

`IDEasy` is shipped with a central command `ide`.
The link:setup.adoc[setup] will automatically register this command so it is available in any shell on your system.
This page describes the Command Line Interface (CLI) of this command.

== Ide

Without any argument the `ide` command will determine your `IDE_HOME` and setup your link:variables.adoc[environment variables] automatically.
In case you are not inside of a `IDEasy` folder the command will echo a message and do nothing.

[source,bash]
--------
[~]$ ide
You are not inside an IDEasy installation: /
[~]$ cd projects/my-project/workspaces/test/my-git-repo
[my-git-repo]$ ide
IDEasy environment variables have been set for /projects/my-project in workspace main
[my-git-repo]$ echo $IDE_HOME
~/projects/my-project
[my-git-repo]$ echo $JAVA_HOME
~/projects/my-project/software/java
--------

== Commandlets

The `ide` command supports a large set of _commandlets_ (sub-commands).
Such commandlet is typically provided as first argument to the ide command and may take additional arguments:

`ide «commandlet» [«arg»]*`

For more details simply call `ide help`.

=== Command-wrapper

For many commandlets the `ide` command acts as a wrapper.
Similar to `mvnw` or `gradlew` you can use it as a proxy command.
Therefore `ide mvn clean install` will be the same as `mvn clean install`.
The benefit when using `ide` as wrapper is that it will even work when the command (`mvn`, `node`, `npm`, etc.) is not on your `PATH` variable or even not yet installed.
Further, it will ensure that the actual command is called with the proper configuration of your project (e.g. in case of `mvn` with the `settings.xml` for your project).
We see the main benefit in this for writing portable scripts that you may commit to your git repository and that will then run everywhere and will lazily install the required tools on the fly.
In your daily usage there is no need to always type `ide` as prefix to every command.
Simply assure that you have called `ide` to setup your environment before calling the actual tool.
