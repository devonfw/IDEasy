= software

The `software` folder contains the third party tools for your IDE such as maven, npm, java, dotnet, etc.
However, `IDEasy` only maintains symbolic links here that point to a local xref:repository[].

== Repository

Technically we "install" (extract) all tools into a local repository (in `$IDE_ROOT/_ide/software`) and just place symbolic links to such physical tool version inside the local repository.
This has the following benefits:

* Switching a tool version forth and back is lightning fast since only a symbolic link needs to be updated.
* We avoid severe issues with link:how-to-unlock-files.adoc[Windows file-locking].
* Multiple IDEasy projects can share the same physical tool versions to save disc-space.
However, we keep previous tool version on updates what can also waste disc-space.
Therefore, you can run `ide cleanup` to find and release old tool versions and free disc-space.

== Custom Tools

In some cases, a project might need a (proprietary) tools that are not directly supported by `IDEasy`.
As a solution for this need, `IDEasy` let's you configure custom tools via `settings/ide-custom-tools.json`.
The following example illustrates how to configure custom tools:
```json
{
  "url": "https://some-file-server.company.com/projects/my-project",
  "tools": [
    {
      "name": "jboss-eap",
      "version": "7.1.4.GA",
      "os-agnostic": true,
      "arch-agnostic": true
    },
    {
      "name": "firefox",
      "version": "70.0.1",
      "os-agnostic": false,
      "arch-agnostic": false
    }
  ]
}
```

This will download and extract the following content to your `software` folder:

* `https://some-file-server.company.com/projects/my-project/jboss-eap/7.1.4.GA/jboss-eap-7.1.4.GA.tgz`
* `https://some-file-server.company.com/projects/my-project/firefox/70.0.1/firefox-70.0.1-windows-x64.tgz`

Please note that if you are not using windows, the `-windows` suffix will be `-mac` or `-linux`.
