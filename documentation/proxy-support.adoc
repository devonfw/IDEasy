IDEasy provides built-in support for automatic HTTP and HTTPS proxy recognition.

== Configuring Proxy Settings

To enable automatic proxy recognition, users need to set the appropriate environment variables in their system, or check if they are already set.
These variables should be formatted as follows, lowercase or uppercase:

[source,bash]
----
http_proxy=http://<host>:<port>
# e.g. http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888
https_proxy=https://<host>:<port>
# e.g. https_proxy=https://127.0.0.1:8888
----

IDEasy utilizes these environment variables to detect and configure proxy settings during runtime.
