= Proxy support

IDEasy provides built-in support for automatic HTTP and HTTPS proxy recognition.

[[proxy-support.adoc_Configuring-Proxy-settings]]
== Configuring Proxy Settings

To enable automatic proxy recognition, users need to set the appropriate environment variables in their system, or check if they are already set.
These variables should be formatted as follows:

[source,bash]
----
http_proxy=http://<host>:<port>
# e.g. http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888
https_proxy=https://<host>:<port>
# e.g. https_proxy=https://127.0.0.1:8888
----

IDEasy utilizes these environment variables to detect and configure proxy settings during runtime.

[[proxy-support.adoc_Advanced-Settings]]
== Advanced Settings

More advanced users can modify the wrapper script to input custom JVM arguments by overriding the `proxy_args` variable.

[source,bash]
----
# example for proxies that need user authentication
proxy_args="-Dhttps.proxyHost=<host> -Dhttps.proxyPort=<port> -Dhttps.proxyUser=<user> -Dhttps.proxyPassword=<password>"
