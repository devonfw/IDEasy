== Project Board
The IDEasy *Project Board* with its Columns should be used as followed:

* *New*: [.underline]#Issues# that are newly created and have yet to be
refined
* *Backlog*: [.underline]#Issues# that are refined but not yet being
worked on
* *Research*: [.underline]#Issues# that are blocked or need complex
research/analysis to make progress. Typically, these are issues that
somebody tried to solve but it turned out to be hard to make progress
and find a solution.
* *In Progress*: [.underline]#Issues# that are currently being worked
on, they must be assigned to the person (or people) working on it. You can
see on the board if there is a pull-request linked to it. If not, the
developer is still working on the story “in the dark”. Otherwise, there
is already a solution implemented. The PR may be in draft state, 
otherwise the PR should be in one of the following two columns.
* *Team Review*: [.underline]#Pull Request# that is to be or currently
under review by a member of the dev team. The reviewer is the assignee
of the PR.
* *In Review*: [.underline]#Pull Request# that is to be or currently
under review by a final reviewer that should also be the assignee of the
PR. Typically the final reviewer is the Project Owner (currently
hohwille) but it may also be done by team members with longer experience
in the project.
* *Done*: [.underline]#Issues# and [.underline]#Pull Request# that have
been completed and merged.

To better organize the board and avoid overload, only pull request are allowed in the review columns.
Issues remain `in progress` until completed via merge of PR.

General conventions for contributions to devonfw can be found
https://github.com/devonfw/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#code-changes[here].
The following conventions are added on top by the IDEasy team from the
learnings & retros for our best way of working together:

== Pull Request

* The title starts with a hashtag and the corresponding issue number (in
case there is no issue to the PR, either create one or use a fitting
epic)
* The title describes what the PR contains, if an issue is fully
completed with the PR, the issue title could be used for example.
* The description starts with a link to the related issue, if this PR
finishes the issue, the following keyword should be used to
automatically link and close the issue upon merging the PR:
** Closes
** For more info see
(https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
* The description can also contain additional information for the PR and
changed files.
* More complicated pull request should contain a short summary of the
changed files and commits.
* In addition, other issue or PRs can be linked, most commonly with
keyword like:
** Blocked by
** Related
** Merge first
* Comments requested changes and other conversations in a pull request
should only be resolved by the person that started them and NOT the
creator of the pull request. (As the permissions might not always allow
this, a final comment by the creator of the conversations, saying it can
be resolved is the second 0ption.)
* Conversations should be answered by the owner of the pull request, so
to show that the suggestion was either implemented or acknowledged.
* The pull request should be assigned to the person that has work on the
PR, either the reviewer or the owner depending on whether a review is to
be done or the review needs to be addressed.
* A pull request should not be a draft when it is in a review.

== Commit

* Commit messages should always start with the issue number and a
hashtag, so to automatically link the corresponding issue.
* The title of a commit should be kept short and informative.
* The description of a commit message can be used to elaborate on the
title.

== Issue

* Issues should be written clearly and easy to comprehend.
* Issues should use the existing template.
* The goal or requirements of the issue should be explained first.
* Potential or desired implementations can or should be described after
the preview point.
* A very good practice and nice to have, are acceptance criteria for the
issue.
* Other issues can be linked using a hashtag and the issue number, most
commonly used keywords:
** Related to
** Blocked by

== Review

* The reviewer should be assigned to the PR, if a review is needed, or
the requested changes need to be checked and conversations need to be
resolved.
* After completing the review, the owner of the PR should be assigned.
* After the team review is finished the PO (hohwille) should be
assigned.
* While reviewing a useful tool is the web ide provided by github.
Simply open the `files changed` tab and press `.` on the keyboard.
* Another useful tool is to use the feature “insert a suggestion” while
writing a comment (for more detail see
https://haacked.com/archive/2019/06/03/suggested-changes/) (This feature
does not reformat the code, so be aware that you need to manually add
the spaces etc.)
