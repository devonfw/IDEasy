= Configurator

`IDEasy` has build-in functionality to configure your IDE.
This allows to merge and manage complex configurations.

== How to use
The easiest way is that you do not care.
When you launch the IDE of your choice (e.g. via `ide eclipse`, `ide intellij`, `ide vscode`), this will happen automatically.

== How it works
For every supported IDE we distinguish the following file structures:

1. _workspace_
+
The actual configuration location of the tool itself.
We configure the tool to relocate this to a specific workspace (so by default `workspaces/main/`).
2. _setup_
+
A configuration location with the configuration only used during the link:setup.adoc[setup]: `settings/«ide»/workspace/setup`.
Contains settings to setup a link:workspaces.adoc[workspace].
After that the user remains control over these settings.
3. _update_
+
A configuration location with the configuration used to update and override: `settings/«ide»/workspace/update`.
Contains settings that are overridden with every update and enforced for every team member.
If a developer manually changes such configuration setting, it will be reset on the next time the IDE gets started.

The configurator will recursively traverse the directory structure of 2. and 3. together.
For each located file `«relative-path»/«file»` it will create or update 1. according to the following rules:

* If `«relative-path»/«file»` is present in 1. (workspace) it will be loaded and used as basis.
* Otherwise if `«relative-path»/«file»` is present in 2. (setup) it will be loaded and used as basis.
* If `«relative-path»/«file»` is present in 3. (update) it will be loaded and merged with the current basis.
* Variables in the from `${«variable-name»}` get resolved if `«variable-name»` is defined.
* If this caused any change the result is written to `«relative-path»/«file»` in 1. (workspace).

In other words this means:

* When your workspace configuration is initially created, 1. is empty. Hence, settings from 2. are used and merged with 3.
* Settings in 2. are therefore used as initial defaults and suggestions but can be changed by the end-user (developer).
Hence, use 2. for things such as themes, UI tweaks, etc.
Once the workspace is configured 2. typically is not relevant anymore.
* Settings in 3. are applied on every update.
By default this happens every time you start your IDE, these settings are managed by the `settings` and in control `configurator`.
If the user modifies such settings and reopens his IDE his changes are reverted.
Hence, use 3. for things such as code-formatters, compiler options, paths to tools shipped with `IDEasy`, etc. that should be consistent and homogeneous for every team-member.

== How to customize

The settings for your ide are located in `settings/«ide»/workspace` where you find the `setup` (2.) and `update` (3.) sub-folders.
E.g. for Eclipse the most relevant settings can be found in `settings/eclipse/workspace/update/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings`.
Of course you could manually edit these settings with a text editor.
However, this requires a lot of knowledge. As we want to provide a great user-experience with `IDEasy` you can also do the following:

* Launch the IDE to configure (e.g. `ide intellij`).
* In case of a non-trivial tweak you may first create a backup copy of the IDE configuration in `workspaces/main` (for IntelliJ in `.intelij` and `.idea` subfolders and for eclipse in `.metadata`).
* Do the desired modification of the configuration via the GUI of your IDE (Preferences dialog).
* Exit your IDE and wait untill it is shutdown
* Call `ws-reverse` command for your IDE (e.g. `ide intellij ws-reverse`) - ensure you do this in the same workspace where you launched and tweaked the config (without intermediate `cd` commands).
* Review the changes to your link:settings.adoc[settings] with a git and diff tool of your choice (e.g. call `git diff`).
* If all looks as expected commit these changes and push them - consider using a feature branch and ask a colleague to test these changes before you apply this to the main branch.
* In case you could not find the expected changes, you may have tweaked a property that is not yet managed.
Therefore, you can try again with `ws-reverse-add` instead of `ws-reverse` (e.g. `ide eclipse ws-reverse-add`) but be aware to revert undesired changes.
Be sure not to add undesired settings that should not be managed.
* In case your changes are in an entirely new configuration file that is currently not managed,
you can simply diff the current workspace folder with the previously created backup copy using a recursive diff tool
(such as winmerge or maybe just `diff -R`).
Once you figured out the relevant change from that diff,
you can manually apply it to the according `«ide»/workspace/update` folder in your `ide-settings` git repository.
