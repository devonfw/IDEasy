= workspaces

The `workspaces` folder contains folders for your active work.
There is a workspace folder `main` dedicated for your primary work.
You may do all your work inside the `main` workspace.
Also, you are free to create any number of additional workspace folders named as you like (e.g. `test`, `release`, `testing`, `my-sub-project`, etc.).
Using multiple workspaces allows to run multiple IDE runtime instances with separate configurations within the same IDEasy project.

Within the workspace folder (e.g. `workspaces/main`) you are again free to create sub-folders for (sub-)projects according to your needs.
We assume that in most cases you clone link:repository.adoc[git repositories] here.
The following structure shows an example layout:

.File structure of workspaces
[subs=+macros]
----
/ workspaces/
├──/ main/
│  ├──/ link:configurator.adoc[.metadata/]
│  ├──/ IDEasy/
│  ├──/ ide-settings/
│  └──/ test-project/
└──/ stable/
   ├──/ link:configurator.adoc[.metadata/]
   └──/ IDEasy/
----

In the `main` workspace you may find the cloned forks for regular work as a base to create pull-requests while in the `stable` workspace there is a clone of the official repository.
Or you have checked out the `main` branch of your project-repository in `main` while in `stable` there is the latest production release branch.
However, this is just an example.
Some people like to create separate workspaces for development and maintenance branches with git.
Other people just switch between those via `git checkout`.
IDEasy offers you great flexibility and you are free to do what makes sense for you.
