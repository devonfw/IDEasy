= Integration Tests

This is an internal documentation for our automated integration tests.

The working dir `(PWD)` is `IDE_ROOT` (it should contain an ide installation) Inherited variables:

* `$IDE_ROOT := PWD`
* All functions in `src/test`

Use `return <EXIT_CODE>` (instead of `exit`) to signal if test passed/failed.

For debugging integration scripts it is a good idea to fail whenever an error occurred (`set -e`).
When you finished writing the test, however, please remove your `set -e` line, since in production it will exit and not run subsequent integration tests.
