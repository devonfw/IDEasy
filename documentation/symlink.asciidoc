= Symlink

The creation of symlinks on windows, with the given function from java requires the user to have administration rights. While we use a workaround in wich we call the mklink command in a command prompt, permissions to create symbolic links can be given to non administrator manually.
Opening `Local Security Policy` (`secpol.msc`) select `Local Policies`/`User Rights Assignment`

1. Right click `Create Symbolic Link`, to open `Propertys` and `Add User or Group`

2. Add the User who should gain the permissions, you might need to be connected to a VPN depending on the company settings.
