= settings

`IDEasy` requires `settings` with configuration templates for the arbitrary tools.

To get an initial set of these settings we provide the default https://github.com/devonfw/ide-settings[ide-settings] as an initial package.
These are also released so you can download the latest stable or any history version at http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|a%3A%22devonfw-ide-settings%22[maven central].

To test `IDEasy` or for very small projects you can also use these the latest default settings (just hit return when link:setup.adoc[setup] is asking for the `Settings URL`).
However, for collaborative projects we strongly encourage you to distribute and maintain the settings via a dedicated and project specific `git` repository.
This gives you the freedom to control and manage the tools with their versions and configurations during the project lifecycle.
Therefore simply follow the link:usage.adoc#admin[admin usage guide].

== Structure
The settings folder (see `link:variables.adoc[SETTINGS_PATH]`) has to follow this file structure:

As you can see, the `settings` folder contains various configurations to customize IDEasy to your project needs.
The key configuration is the top-level `ide.properties` file.
The `template` folder contains templates that will be applied to `$IDE_HOME` and therefore allow to define the initial content of the `conf` folder with the defaults for the developer specific link:configuration.adoc[configuration] (e.g. `settings.xml` and `ide.properties`).
Further, for the IDEs such as https://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse], https://code.visualstudio.com/[VSCode], or https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ] the according folders contain the templates to manage the workspace via our link:configurator.adoc[configurator].

== Configuration Philosophy
Different tools and configuration files require a different handling:

* Where suitable, we directly use these configurations from your `settings` (e.g. for `eclipse/lifecycle-mapping-metadata.xml`, or `eclipse/project.dictionary`).
* The `template` folder in `settings` contains templates for configuration files.
They are copied to the `IDEasy` installation during link:setup.adoc[setup] (if no such file already exists).
In this way the `settings` repository can provide reasonable defaults but allows the user to take over control and customize to his personal needs (e.g. `.m2/settings.xml`).
* For tools with complex configuration structures like Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VScode we provide a smart mechanism via our link:configurator.adoc[configurator].

== Customize Settings
You can easily customize these settings for the requirements of your project.
We suggest that one team member is responsible to ensure that everything stays consistent and works.
However, every team member can contribute changes as pull-/merge-requests.

You may also create new sub-folders in `settings` and put individual items according to your needs.
E.g. you could add scripts for https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/greasemonkey[greasemonkey] or https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo[tampermonkey],
as well as scripts for your database or whatever may be useful and worth to share in your team.
However, to share and maintain knowledge we recommend to use a wiki.
